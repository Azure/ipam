## Deploying the Solution

The IPAM solution is deployed via a PowerShell deployment script, `deploy.ps1`,  found in the `deploy` directory of the project. The infrastructure stack is defined via Azure Bicep files. The deployment can be performed via your local machine or from the development container found in the project. You have the following options for deployment:

- Two-part deployment
  - Part 1: App Registrations only
    - Configuration details are saved to a `parameters.json` file which will be shared with the infrastructure team
  - Part 2: Infrastructure Stack only
    - UI and Engine containers hosted in App Service or...
    - Engine container hosted in an Azure Function
- Deploy the entire solution (App Registrations + Azure Infrastructure)
  - UI and Engine containers hosted in App Service or...
  - Engine container hosted in an Azure Function

The two-part deployment option is provided in the event that a single team doesn't have the necessary permissions to deploy both the App Registrations in Azure AD, and the Azure infrastructure stack. In the event that you do have all of the the necessary permissions in Azure AD and on the Azure infrastructure side, then you have the option to deploy the entire solution all at once.

## Full Deployment

To deploy the full solution, run the following from within the `deploy` directory:

```powershell
./deploy.ps1 -Location "westus3" 
 ```

You have the ability to pass optional flags to the deployment script:

| Parameter                                       | Description                                                               |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-UIAppName <name>`                             | Changes the name of the UI app registration                               |
| `-EngineAppName <name>`                         | Changes the name of the Engine app registration                           |
| `-Tags @{​​​​​​<tag> = '​<value>'; ​<tag> = '​<value>'}` | Attaches the hashtable as tags on the deployed IPAM resource group        |
| `-NamePrefix <prefix>`                          | Replaces the default resource prefix of "ipam" with an alternative prefix |
| `-AsFunction`                                   | Deploys the engine container only to an Azure Function                    |
| `-PrivateACR`                                   | Deploys a private Azure Container Registry and builds the IPAM containers |

**Customize the name of the App Registrations:**

```powershell
./deploy.ps1 `
  -Location "westus3" `
  -UIAppName "my-ui-app-reg" `
  -EngineAppName "my-engine-app-reg"
```

**Change the name prefix for the Azure resources:**

```powershell
./deploy.ps1 `
  -Location "westus3" `
  -NamePrefix "devipam"
```

**Add custom tags to the Azure resources:**

```powershell
./deploy.ps1 `
  -Location "westus3" `
  -Tags @{owner = 'ipamadmin@example.com'; environment = 'development'}
```

**Deploy IPAM solution as an Azure Function:**

```powershell
./deploy.ps1 `
  -Location "westus3" `
  -AsFunction
```

**Deploy IPAM solution with a private Container Registry:**

```powershell
./deploy.ps1 `
  -Location "westus3" `
  -PrivateACR
```

## App Registration Only Deployment

To deploy App Registrations only, run the following from within the `deploy` directory:

```powershell
./deploy.ps1 -AppsOnly
````

You have the ability to pass optional flags to the deployment script:

| Parameter               | Description                                                                                         |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-UIAppName <name>`     | Changes the name of the UI app registration                                                         |
| `-EngineAppName <name>` | Changes the name of the Engine app registration                                                     |
| `-AsFunction`           | Indicates that this solution will be deployed as an Azure Function, no UI App Registration required |

**Customize the name of the App Registrations:**

```powershell
./deploy.ps1 `
  -AppsOnly `
  -UIAppName "my-ui-app-reg" `
  -EngineAppName "my-engine-app-reg"
```

**Deploy IPAM solution as an Azure Function:**

```powershell
./deploy.ps1 `
  -AppsOnly `
  -AsFunction
```

As part of the app registration deployment, a `main.parameters.json` file is generated with pre-populated parameters for the app registration IDs as well as the engine app registration secret. This parameter file will then be used to perform the infrastructure deployment.

## Infrastructure Stack (Only) Deployment

To deploy infrastructure only, ensure you have the auto-generated `main.parameters.json` file created by the [App Registration Only](#app-registration-only-deployment) deployment in your `deploy` directory. Alternatively, you can generate your own using `main.parameters.example.json` as an example template.

Once your parameters file is ready, run the following from within the `deploy` directory:

```powershell
./deploy.ps1 `
  -Location "westus3" `
  -ParameterFile ./main.parameters.json
 ```

You have the ability to pass optional flags to the deployment script:

| Parameter                                       | Description                                                               |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-Tags @{​​​​​​<tag> = '​<value>'; ​<tag> = '​<value>'}`​ | Attaches the hashtable as tags on the deployed IPAM resource group        |
| `-NamePrefix <prefix>`                          | Replaces the default resource prefix of "ipam" with an alternative prefix |
| `-PrivateACR`                                   | Deploys a private Azure Container Registry and builds the IPAM containers |

**Add custom tags to the Azure resources:**

```powershell
./deploy.ps1 `
  -Location "westus3" `
  -ParameterFile ./main.parameters.json `
  -Tags @{owner = 'ipamadmin@example.com'; environment = 'development'}
```

**Change the name prefix for the Azure resources:**

```powershell
./deploy.ps1 `
  -Location "westus3" `
  -ParameterFile ./main.parameters.json `
  -NamePrefix "devipam"
```

**Deploy IPAM solution with a private Container Registry:**

```powershell
./deploy.ps1 `
  -Location "westus3" `
  -ParameterFile ./main.parameters.json `
  -PrivateACR
```
