## FAQ

**Why should I use IPAM?**
You realize that you do not have a clear picture as to what is deployed into your Azure environment and connected to your private IP address space. Or, you would like a way to easily manage, assign, and track your private IP addess space usage!

**What does the roadmap for IPAM look like?**
- We are assessing leveraging Azure Container Apps for hosting the two containers that make up the IPAM application
- We are assessing support for multiple Tenants, as today the tool is designed with a single Tenant in mind
- We are working on capturing IP address infromation for resources that support hybrid connectivity (ie Gateways)

**Who are the awesome people that built this solution??**
Matt and Harvey are Architects at Microsoft! We are always on the look out for interesting ways to help our customers overcome their challenges!
